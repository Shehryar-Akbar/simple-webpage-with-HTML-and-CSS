			<h3>About Super Computer</h3>
			<br>
			<p>
			I The Use of Supercomputers
			The first electronic computers were designed for military use around 1950 and were used to calculate ballistic orbits. Soon afterward (1951) the first commercial computers emerged, to be employed for all kinds of scientific and technical computations. This is still the most important realm for today's supercomputers, although the application field has diversified greatly over the years.
			</p>
			<p>
			An area in which supercomputers have become indispensible is weather forecasting and research in climatology. The quality of weather forecasts has been increasing steadily with that of the numerical models that describe the motions of air, moisture, and driving forces such as sunshine and temperature differences. The price to be paid for these more refined models is the increased amount of computation to be done. In particular, for weather forecasting the timeliness of the results is of obvious importance, so for more intricate weather models, computers have to be faster to meet the time requirements.
			</p>
			<p>
			Weather models are only one of the manifestations of computer models that deal with phemonema of the flow of gases and fluids, free, in pipes or in ocean beds, or around bodies such as aircraft or cars. This large family of models is the realm of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In the CFD field vast amounts of supercomputer power are used to investigate climate change, the optimal shape of an aircraft wing (the computer model constituting a “numerical windtunnel”), or the behavior of heated plasma in the Sun's corona.
			</p>
			<p>
			Also, safety issues for complicated building structures and, again, aircraft and cars are amenable to computer modeling. This area is called structural analysis. The structures under investigation are divided into thousands to millions of subregions, each of which is subjected to forces, temperature changes, etc., that cause the deformation of these regions and stresses in the materials used. Car crash analysis is, in this respect, an obviously important topic that requires supercomputer power to model the deformation of a car's body at impact with other bodies of various sizes, at different speeds, and under different angles. A subject where the CFD and structural analysis fields are combined in a highly complicated way is the Nuclear Stockpile Stewardship, in which it is attempted to replace actual testing of nuclear weapons, sometimes by explosion, by simulation of the testing circumstances with numerical models that integrate the computational components. Especially, the stockpile stewardship has been an enormous incentive for the development of new and faster supercomputers via the Accelerated Strategic Computer Initiative (ASCI) in the United States.

			At a more fundamental level, computer models are used to investigate the structure of materials to help understand superconductivity and other phenomena that require knowledge about how electrons behave in semiconducting and conducting materials. Also, the reaction mechanisms in organic and bioorganic molecules and, indeed, their three-dimensional shape depend on the electronic structure in these molecules and, ultimately, their activity in biological systems as building material for living cells or as the key components for medicines. The computer models describing and evaluating all these aspects on an atomic molecular scale are in the field of numerical quantum physics and quantum chemistry. Vast amounts of supercomputing time are spent in this broad field, looking for new medicines, unraveling the structure of viruses, or trying to find higher-temperature superconductors.
			</p>
			<p>
			In recent years parallel supercomputers have penetrated in areas where computing formerly had no or only a marginal role, for instance, in analysis and prediction of stock exchange rates. Large amounts of computing power are used here to evaluate the many time series and differential equations that model these rates. Furthermore, massive data processing in the form of advanced database processing and data mining relies these days on parallel supercomputers to deliver the timely results required in controlling stock, building customer profiles, and building new knowledge based on hidden patterns in data that were almost-inaccessible before because of their shear size. A subfield that depends critically on this massive data processing is the Human Genome Project, which adds vast amounts of DNA data to the part of the genome that has already been mapped. The amount of data is so large that databases of databases are necessary to handle it. In addition, not all these data are entirely reliable, and they have to be screened and reinserted as the knowledge in this huge project grows. Still, the raw data thus becoming available are just the starting point of all that can be known and done with it. Often quantum chemical and molecular dynamics techniques are used to discover the function and importance of the DNA sequences, and matching with known, almost-identical but subtly different sequences has to be done to assess the influence that, for instance, the exact form has on their activity and function.

			<p>
			Although this is by no means an exhaustive recounting of all the situations that call for the use of supercomputers, it illustrates that supercomputers are wonderfully flexible research instruments. Two general statements about their use can be safely made. First, the number of application fields will expand still more in the near-future, and, second, there is an insatiable need for even higher computing speeds. So we may assume that the notion of supercomputers will be with us for the forseeable future.
